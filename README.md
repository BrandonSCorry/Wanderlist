# Wanderlist
A wander list for your wanderlust!

## About
Wanderlist allows users to generate, save and store their travel plans. They can store their pre-travel checklist, hotel and flight details as well as their itinerary. 

Wanderlist is fully mobile responsive!

## Technologies
Wanderlist was built in JavaScript using Node.js and MySQL. We utilized HTML, CSS and the CSS framework Bulma on the client side. On the server side, we used Express, Passport and the Sequelize packages to build out the communication between the databases and to create a OAuth login server.
